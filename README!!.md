# Intro
# Hello we're group6 and we are creating a data analysis and a data visualization program that analyzes statistical data about U.S. Chronic diseases from 50 different states.

# You will need the following files: AQI_per_state.csv, TEENBIRTH2015.csv, and U.S._Chronic_Disease_Indicators__CDI_new.csv
# You will need to use these files as arguments in this order: U.S._Chronic_Disease_Indicators__CDI_new.csv,  AQI_per_state.csv

# 1) You will need to input two states and it a bar graph will show up comparing those states. (note: some states have no value -- it will only show one bar for the state that has a value and tell you which state does not have a value)

# 2) You will be asked to input 5 states and it will show you a bar graph of overall asthma rates for 2015 -- you can input up to 5 states but if you only want two states then input two and type 'done'

# 3) You will be asked to input one state and it will print out a graph of asthma rates of women, men, and overall for the state that you input
